The Red Hat JBoss A-MQ NMS client is a .Net client that communicates with the JBoss A-MQ broker using its native Openwire protocol. This client supports advanced features such as failover, discovery, SSL, and message compression.
For complete details of using the .Net API see http://activemq.apache.org/nms/index.html.

NOTE: In order to use the NMS API, you will need to download the source and build it for your environment.
